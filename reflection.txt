While working on this project, I faced many issues like using tuples, understanding how queues and stacks work, and getting my autograder to work. To fix these issues, I used W3 schools, youtube, and instructional textbooks. After doing so, I eventually got a grasp of what I needed to do for the project. Even after all of the issues, I would personally say that I enjoyed the challenge this project gave me and how I was able to learn more.
